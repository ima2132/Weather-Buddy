## Description 
The main objective of this project is to create a weather dashboard that can be accessed through a web browser. The dashboard incorporates dynamic updates to its HTML and CSS and utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

Weather Buddy is essentially a user-friendly application that allows users to search for their desired city, view the current weather forecast/conditions (location, temperature, humidity, and wind speed), and presents a 5-day weather forecast in that selected city. Users are also able to view their previously searched cities in a section beneath the weather display. 
## User Story

Weather Buddy also provides users with a 5-day forecast for the selected city, as it utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the necessary weather data.

Weather Buddy displays the current weather information on the screen, presenting details such as the location, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Users are also presented with a section that showcases their previous city search entries.

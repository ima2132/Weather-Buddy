## Description 
The main objective of this project is to create a weather dashboard that can be accessed through a web browser. The dashboard incorporates dynamic updates to its HTML and CSS and utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

Weather Buddy is essentially a user-friendly application that allows users to search for their desired city, view the current weather forecast/conditions (location, temperature, humidity, and wind speed), and presents a 5-day weather forecast in that selected city. Users are also able to view their previously searched cities in a section beneath the weather display. 
## User Story
